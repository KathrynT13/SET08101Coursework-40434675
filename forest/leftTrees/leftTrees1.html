		A decides to go left.
		<br>The trees are a lot thicker and darker than they were before, so she lights her lantern so she can see the way.
		<br>She can see a sign pointing out two directions, but the paint saying whatever they lead to had long since faded away.
		<br>The trees seem to get more sparse again for both ways, but A isn't sure which way to go.
		<br>Which way should she go?
