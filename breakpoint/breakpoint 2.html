		<p class="catDialogue">Someone who knows their way around these woods. What're you looking for, may I ask?</p>
		<p class="aDialogue">...I'm looking for my mother. She's been gone for a very long time, much longer than usual. She must've gone into these woods, so I'm trying to find her.</p>
		<p class="catDialogue">I see... Well, you might find what you're looking for if you follow this path.</p>
		<p class="description">The cat points to the left path.</p>
		<p class="aDialogue">...How do I know if I can trust you?</p>
		<p class="description">The cat chuckles. <span class="catDialogue">How DO you know, indeed? You're a smart one, aren't you?
		<br>Well...I guess you'll just have to find that one out on your own.</span></p>
