		There is a very clear set path leading forward. Perhaps that cat had the right idea after all.
		<br>After a few minutes of walking, A finds a sudden empty clearing with a lone stone well in the middle.
		<!--Hover text: looking inside, the well is very deep. VERY deep. A can't even see the bottom, let alone any water.-->
		<br><span class="aDialogue">That's strange. Why would a well be out this far? It looks pretty empty, too.</span>
		<br>A shrugs this strange discovery off and keeps moving.
