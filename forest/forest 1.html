		A walks along the dirt track leading into the dark woods.
		<br>The trees around her are tall, thick and very dark.
		<br>After a while of walking and looking around, she starts to get hungry.
	</p>
	<p class="aDialogue">...Maybe skipping breakfast before leaving to save time wasn't the best idea...</p>
	<p class="description">
		Thankfully, a nearby apple tree catches A's eye.
		<br>Huzzah! Salvation!
		<br>...But wait, mother said these woods are dangerous, didn't she? These apples could be poisoned for all she knows.
		<br>A starts to walk past, but her stomach growls in protest.
		<br>What should she do?
