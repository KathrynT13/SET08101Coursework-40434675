			There is a very clear set path leading forward. Perhaps that cat had the right idea after all.
			<br>After a few minutes of walking, A finds a sudden empty clearing with
			<a href="#" class="infoText"
			onMouseOver="alert('It looks very old, must have been here a long time. Looking inside, the well is very deep. VERY deep. A cant even see the bottom, let alone any water.');">
			a lone stone well in the middle.</a>

			<br><span class="aDialogue">That's strange. Why would a well be out this far? It looks pretty empty, too.</span>
			<br>A shrugs this strange discovery off and keeps moving.
