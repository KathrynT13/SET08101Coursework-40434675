		<br><span class="aDialogue">You know mother?? Do you have any idea where she is?</span>
		<br>The owl shakes its head. <span class="owlDialogue">Unfortunately, no. She hasn't passed through these woods in a long time, hoo.</span>
		<br>A sighs, dejected.
		<br><span class="owlDialogue">You seem tired, young one.</span>
		<br><span class="aDialogue">It's just that I spent all day looking for her and I haven't seen her anywhere...</span>
		<br>The owl tilts its head. <span class="owlDialogue">Understandable, a child of your age shouldn't be running around these woods on their own. You could get lost.
		<br>I can take you home if you want! I know a shortcut!</span>
