		A decides to go right.
		<br>The river is moving very fast; it sweeps up nearby rocks with ease.
		<br>There is a rope bridge across it, but it doesn't look like it'll last for much longer. <strong>Especially</strong> if A steps on it too hard.
		<br>She looks around for other options to cross the river and finds one: a number of large stones just surfacing above the water.
		<br>They're spaced out, but if A hops across them just right, she'll be able to cross the river. But on the other hand, one wrong move and she'll slip and fall.
		<br>A is weighing her options. Both the bridge and the stones could get her across, but they also could get her swept away.
		<br>What should she do?
